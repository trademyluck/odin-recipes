        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Korean Fried Chicken</strong> is a variety of fried chicken dishes created in South Korea. It is usually called <i>chikin</i> (치킨, from the English “chicken”) in Korea. The basic fried chicken flavors would be plain fried chicken (<i>huraideu-chicken</i>) and sweet-and-spicy or seasoned chicken (<i>yangnyeom</i>). Korean fried chicken is often a small or medium sized chicken as younger chickens have tender meat. The breading is slightly different from other fried chickens.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Marinade</h3>
            <ul>

            <h3>Batter</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3/4 cup cornstarch</li>
                <li>1/2 cup self-rising flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup very cold water, or as needed</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make marinade: Stir together chicken, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until chicken is coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 340 degrees F (171 degrees C).</li>
            <li>While oil is heating, make batter: Whisk together cornstarch, flour, sugar, pepper, and salt in a large bowl. Gradually whisk in cold water until mixture resembles smooth pancake batter. Use tongs to remove chicken from marinade to batter; stir to coat chicken completely. Discard marinade.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, fry chicken in hot oil for 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cooling rack.</li>
            <li>Increase oil temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Working in batches, fry chicken again in hot oil until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.</li>
            <li>Serve with <em>Korean Fried Chicken Sauce.</em></li>
            </ol>
