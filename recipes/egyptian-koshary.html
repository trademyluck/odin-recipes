        <h2>Description</h2>

It is a traditional Egyptian staple, mixing pasta, Egyptian fried rice, vermicelli and brown lentils, and topped with a zesty tomato sauce, garlic vinegar and garnished with chickpeas and crispy fried onions.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed</li> 
            <li>1/4 cup red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 (16 ounce) package ditalini pasta</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups short-grain rice, rinsed</li>
            <li>cold water, to cover</li>   
            <li>1 1/2 cups dark brown lentils</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, minced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>3 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 (3 ounce) can French-fried onions</li>  
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine chickpeas, vinegar, coriander, cayenne pepper, and cumin in a resealable bag or container with a tight-fitting lid. Store in refrigerator while prepping remainder of dish, shaking occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine rice with enough cold water to cover; allow to soak for 20 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine lentils with enough water to cover in a pot; season with salt and pepper. Bring the lentils to a boil and simmer until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes; season with salt and pepper, reduce heat to medium-low, and maintain at a simmer while preparing remainder of dish.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a pot over medium-high heat; add rice, increase heat to high, and fry for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour in chicken stock and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper; reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix rice and lentils together on a large serving platter. Spread cooked pasta over the rice and lentil mixture. Serve with marinated chickpeas, tomato sauce, and French-fried onions.</li>
        </ol>
